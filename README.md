# pygame-Breakout
A Blocks Breakout game made using pygame 2.5 with Python 3.10

## Instructions
A moves the paddle left.
D moves the paddle right.
SPACE stops the paddle.

## Gameplay
Get the highest score by eliminating blocks with the ball.
Move the paddle to keep the ball in play.
If the ball touches the bottom of the play area, the game ends and your score is shown.
When moved the paddle keeps moving until SPACE is pressed or the paddle touches the edge of the play area.
The ball and paddle speed up over time.
If all blocks are cleared, the next time the ball hits the paddle will create a new set of blocks, and all new points will be doubled.
